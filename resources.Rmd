Reading in the data for the resources 

```{r}
farmer_markets = 
  read_csv(file= "./data/DOHMH_Farmers_Markets.csv") 

gardens = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Greenthumb_Community_Gardens.csv")

healthy_stores=
  read_csv(file = "./data/Recognized_Shop_Healthy_Stores.csv")
```

Doing the data cleaning for the datasets 

```{r}
farmer_markets_clean = 
  farmer_markets %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename("Borough"= borough) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

```{r}
gardens_clean = 
  gardens %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename("Borough" = boro) %>% 
  mutate(Borough = recode(Borough, "M"= "Manhattan",
                                "B"= "Brooklyn",
                                "X"= "Bronx",
                                "Q"= "Queens",
                                "S"= "Staten Island")) %>% 
  drop_na ()
```

```{r}
healthy_stores_clean = 
  healthy_stores %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename("Borough"= borough) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

Going to join the data all together 

```{r}
joined_data_1 = 
  left_join(farmer_markets_clean, gardens_clean, by = "Borough")
```

```{r}
joined_data_2 = 
   merge(farmer_markets_clean, gardens_clean, by.x = "Borough", by.y = "Borough")
```
